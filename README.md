# Application supporting software development effort estimation

Accurate software development effort estimation is a serious challenge for every organization, because with each year the size of the software and its complexity are increasing. In connection with this in past decades many estimation techniques were developed with the goal to achieve good results with acceptable margin of error. Two of them: Use Case Points (UCP) and COCOMO II were implemented in designed application according to a method proposed by C. F. Kre√ü, O. Hummel and M. Huq in a conference paper: "A Practical Approach for Reliable Pre-Project Estimation" submitted to REFSQ 2014. The main advantage of using this combination is an ability to estimate large programming projects in their early phase, when only description of requirements done by business analysts in the form of use cases is available. In order to facilitate the work with designed application it is equipped with the graphical user interface that displays hints about entered data and shows results in convenient form, marking exceeded project constraints. Furthermore application also allows calibrating the estimation model with historical data that comes from organization performing the estimation and provides embedded estimation wizard that helps beginning users to make step-by-step effort estimations. If the need arises, application also provides the possibility to save performed estimations in order to use them again and allows printing and exporting of estimation reports to PDF or RTF file formats.
